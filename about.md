Hey there, I'm Justin and you've found my personal blog. I live in California and I write mainly about software development. My interests include Rust, C++, Python, Qt, Linux, realtime/messaging, and open standards.

Major projects I've worked on:

* [Fanout][fanout-website] - Realtime data push platform (now part of Fastly).
* Livefyre - Commenting platform (acquired by Adobe, later [shut down][livefyre-discontinued]).
* [Psi][psi-website] - Instant messaging app, supporting XMPP and VoIP.
* [Infinity][infinity-website] - Role-playing game for the Game Boy Color (canceled in 2001, resumed by Retro Modding in 2021).

Many of the old posts here were originally written for the Delta XMPP Project blog, which was shut down in February 2017.
