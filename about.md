Hey there, I'm Justin and you've found my personal blog. I live in California and I write mainly about software development. My interests include C++, Python, Qt, Linux, realtime/messaging, and open standards.

Major projects I've worked on:

* [Pushpin][pushpin-website] - Reverse proxy for realtime services.
* [Livefyre][livefyre] - Commenting platform (now part of Adobe).
* [Psi][psi-website] - Instant messaging app, supporting XMPP and VoIP.
* [Infinity][infinity-website] - Role-playing game for Game Boy Color (unpublished, later open-sourced).

Many of the old posts here were originally written for the Delta XMPP Project blog, which was shut down in February 2017.
